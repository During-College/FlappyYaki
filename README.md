# FlappyYaki

This game was created based on the famous "Flappy Bird" from scratch on Visual Studios
utilizing SFML as a way of getting practice with C++. The game is called "Flappy Yaki"
because of a friend who goes by the name of "Yaki Ramen" online, and we tend to poke
fun at him in good fun, and I wanted a chance to use a few sound clips that I've been
saving for a while.

Please do not distribute without permission!

To run the game, please have Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015

After it has been installed, please make sure the FlappyYaki folder is unzipped and
then proceed to run "FlappyYaki.exe" (Application) to play the game.
